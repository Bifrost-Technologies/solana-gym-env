# Solana Gym: Critical Blockers & Limitations

## üö® Priority 1: Critical Blockers (Must Fix)

### 1. **Single Transaction Per Skill Limitation**
**Issue**: Skills can only return one transaction receipt, but agents might naturally try to:
- Send multiple transactions in sequence
- Build complex multi-step operations
- Lose intermediate transaction data

**Impact**: Agents can't learn complex DeFi strategies that require multiple transactions

**Solutions**:
- Option A: Modify return type to support array of receipts: `[reward, done_reason, tx_receipts[]]`
- Option B: Enforce single-transaction design and make it explicit in prompts
- Option C: Support "transaction batching" where multiple instructions go in one transaction

### 2. **Overly Simplistic Mock Environment**
**Issue**: The mock in `runSkill.ts` doesn't simulate real Solana:
- Static wallet balances `[2.5, 100.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]`
- No real program interaction
- No account data or SPL tokens
- Always returns success

**Impact**: Skills that work in mock won't work on real Solana

**Solutions**:
- Integrate with Surfpool's actual RPC interface
- Build realistic mock with state tracking
- Use Anchor's testing framework for better simulation

### 3. **No Persistent Memory Between Episodes**
**Issue**: `protocols_seen` resets every episode, no learning across runs

**Impact**: Agents restart from zero knowledge each episode

**Solutions**:
- Implement experience replay buffer
- Track skill performance metrics across episodes
- Build proper RAG store for skill retrieval

### 4. **Missing RAG Implementation**
**Issue**: `rag.py` is empty - no vector store for skill similarity

**Impact**: Can't retrieve relevant skills, leading to duplicate generation

**Solutions**:
- Implement NumPy-based vector store as planned
- Add skill embedding generation
- Build similarity search for skill retrieval

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Priority 2: Major Limitations

### 5. **Limited Observation Space**
**Issue**: Agent can't see:
- Market prices or liquidity
- Protocol-specific state (pool reserves, rates)
- Historical data or trends
- Gas costs or transaction details

**Impact**: Can't make informed trading decisions

**Solutions**:
- Add price feed integration
- Expand observation with protocol state
- Include recent transaction history

### 6. **No Error Learning**
**Issue**: Agents don't learn from failures:
- Errors are stringified, losing structure
- No classification of error types
- Failed skills aren't improved

**Impact**: Agents repeat the same mistakes

**Solutions**:
- Structured error types
- Error pattern recognition
- Skill improvement mechanism

### 7. **Skill Library Limitations**
**Issue**: 
- No duplicate detection
- No skill versioning or updates
- Unbounded growth
- No performance tracking

**Impact**: Library becomes cluttered with redundant/bad skills

**Solutions**:
- Content-based deduplication
- Performance-based pruning
- Skill categorization system

## üìã Priority 3: Architectural Improvements

### 8. **Type Safety Issues**
**Issue**: TypeScript skills use `any` for environment type

**Impact**: No compile-time safety, runtime errors

**Solutions**:
- Define proper TypeScript interfaces
- Generate type definitions from Python

### 9. **Limited Token Support**
**Issue**: Only tracks 10 tokens, but Solana has thousands

**Impact**: Can't interact with most SPL tokens

**Solutions**:
- Dynamic token discovery
- Configurable token list
- Token metadata integration

### 10. **No Resource Management**
**Issue**: No tracking of:
- SOL balance changes
- Computation units used
- Transaction costs
- Rate limits

**Impact**: Can't optimize for efficiency

**Solutions**:
- Track resource usage per skill
- Add cost to reward function
- Implement resource budgets

## üîß Quick Fixes (Low Effort, High Impact)

1. **Update Prompts**: Explicitly tell LLM about single transaction limit
2. **Add Logging**: Better visibility into skill execution
3. **Improve Error Messages**: More actionable error feedback
4. **Document Limitations**: Make constraints clear in docs
5. **Add Validation**: Check skills before registration

## üìä Blocker Impact Matrix

| Blocker | Impact on Learning | Impact on Real Usage | Effort to Fix |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Single Transaction | High | Critical | Medium |
| Mock Environment | Critical | Critical | High |
| No Memory | High | High | Medium |
| Missing RAG | High | Medium | Low |
| Limited Observations | Medium | High | Medium |
| No Error Learning | Medium | Medium | Low |
| Skill Library | Low | Medium | Low |

## üöÄ Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (1-2 weeks)
1. Fix single transaction limitation (choose approach)
2. Implement basic RAG store
3. Add error classification
4. Update prompts with constraints

### Phase 2: Realism (2-4 weeks)
1. Integrate real Surfpool RPC
2. Expand observation space
3. Add transaction cost tracking
4. Implement skill deduplication

### Phase 3: Intelligence (4-6 weeks)
1. Add cross-episode memory
2. Build skill performance tracking
3. Implement error-based learning
4. Create skill improvement system

### Phase 4: Scale (6-8 weeks)
1. Dynamic token support
2. Multi-agent preparation
3. Resource optimization
4. Production safety measures
